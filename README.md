# API-Project
This API project required that we use at least two API's and Firebase to create an app of our groups choosing.  

We decided to use cover movies since our group's first dicussion was about movies.  The first API is oMDB which covers the basic details for the movies input into the user search.  The second API is NYTimes Movie Reviews and the third is The Movie Database in conjunction with YouTube to get a movie trailer. And finally, we used Firebase to store the user search input.
